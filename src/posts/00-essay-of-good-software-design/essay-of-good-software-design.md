I listed some points from what I consider that a software product workflow must have to be successful. These are points built from a mix of hands-on experience and ideas from books that I read.

Software development is a discipline with a lot of trade-offs and each flow have their own characteristics, so, maybe all the points I'm listing here don't make anysense for another developer that have a completed different experience from my own.

Also, this is an ongoing list. The purpose of this list in first place is to built an reference for myself :). I may remove or add new points at the future.
